# Example

## Integration

There are several examples of integration of the AVIS API with a real-world, productive manufacturing environment.

1. Capture pictures with a Luxonis
   camera: [examples/take-picture-luxonis-camera](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/take-picture-luxonis-camera)
2. Interact with the AVIS API using the python client (open a case, add pictures, get inspection results,
   etc...): [examples/use-avis-client](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/use-avis-client)

For an end-to-end example of automation (signaling using modbus tcp, taking pictures using a luxonis camera, interacting
with the AVIS API using a python client) see the agent's code
in [examples/agent](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/)
