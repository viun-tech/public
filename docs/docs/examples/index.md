# Example

## Integration

There are several examples of integration of the AVIS API with real-world, productive manufacturing environments and setups.

1. Capture pictures with a Luxonis
   camera: [examples/take-picture-luxonis-camera](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/take-picture-luxonis-camera)
2. Interact with the AVIS API using the python client (open an inspection, add pictures, get inspection results,
   etc...): [examples/use-avis-client](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/use-avis-client)
3. Example of a full inspection cycle using the two examples above: [examples/full-cycle](https://github.com/vuengineering/public/tree/main/examples/full-cycle)
